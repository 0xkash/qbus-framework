# SKAdmin
A FiveM script which implements an admin trainer, with admin options and basic trainer options.

## Installing
1. Create a new folder in /resources and name it *SkAdmin*.
2. Copy the files to that folder.
3. Add the line ```start SkAdmin``` to your *server.cfg*.
4. Create a directory named "skadmin_saves" or with the name you use in Config.settings.saves_directory. This directory has to be create as a subdirectory of server-data.
4. Restart or start your server.

## Config

In sv_config.lua:  
To change the name of the save directory change the value of Config.settings.saves_directory

### Admin List File
In sv_config.lua:  
To change the name of this file change the value of Config.settings.banlist_file

### Event Chat Messages & Event Console Messages
In sv_config.lua:  
You can turn on and off this in Config.settings.event_messages and Config.settings.event_messages_console, respectively.

## Notes
1. Is extremely important to create skadmin_saves directory. You can change then name of the folder and files in Config.settings.saves_directory
